I was unable to get a playlist area working, which is something I thought would be cool to add. It took me a while to figure out how to connect the volume to the slider but I got it working eventually. This assignment reminded me of the Java Swing toolkit, which I used a little in a Java class I took last year. I thought it was a relatively easy assignment this time around, but that's probably because my media player is really simple. I hope to get the playlist area working soon.
